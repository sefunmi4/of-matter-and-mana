# Of Matter & Mana

A developer journey told as an interactive spellbook. This repository combines narrative coding, a ripple-based view of spacetime, and research into quantum mechanics.

## Why
Describing hardware (matter) and software (mana) in the language of magic helps build intuition. It also sets the stage for a moral tale about the cost of technology and the choices we make as developers.

## Rules of Spells
1. All magic comes at a cost.
2. Let history be your teacher and books track its lessons.
3. Use stories to understand the dangers before you "cast" a "spell".
4. Ideas are like mana, matter is the medium, and physics is the mechanism.

## Getting Started
Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Repository Layout
- **client/** – React components for the spellbook UI and ripple visualizer.
- **server/** – API endpoints and a simple ripple engine for simulations.
- **game-engine/** – Core physics and time navigation utilities.
- **spellbooks/** – Chapters of spells and narrative content.
- **docs/** – Research notes and glossary entries.

The `quantum mechanics` folder contains the ongoing paper *Ripples in Spacetime and Quantum Branches*, which explores a polar coordinate approach to quantum wavefunctions. Source files are under `quantum mechanics/paper`.

## Contributing
This project is experimental. Contributions that expand the spellbooks, improve the ripple engine, or elaborate on the research are welcome.
