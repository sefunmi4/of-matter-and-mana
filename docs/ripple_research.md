# Ripple-Based Visualization

This document summarizes key ideas from the paper **Ripples in Spacetime and Quantum Branches**. The goal is to model wavefunctions in polar coordinates, treating time as a radial dimension while angles represent spatial coordinates. This approach builds on the equation

\[s^2 = c^2 t^2 - x^2\]

from special relativity to unify quantum dynamics and relativistic effects.

Further details can be found in the LaTeX source under `quantum mechanics/paper`.
