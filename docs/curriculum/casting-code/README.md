### Arrays & Hashing Exercises
1. **Contains Duplicates** – Determine if any value appears more than once.
2. **Valid Anagram** – Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
3. **Two Sum** – Find indices `i` and `j` where `nums[i] + nums[j] = target`.
4. **Group Anagrams** – Group strings that are anagrams.
5. **Top K Frequent Elements** – Return the `k` most frequent values in an array.
6. **Encode & Decode String** – Design an algorithm to encode and decode a list of strings.
7. **Product of Array Except Self** – Return an array where each position is the product of all other values.
8. **Longest Consecutive Sequence** – Find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
